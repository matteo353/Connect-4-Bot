Constructed an agent that uses the minimax algorithm to play a variation of connect-4 against other agents or humans. Implemented a heuristic called by a depth limit agent to be able to compete on larger game boards. The game can be played by inputting into your terminal:
'python connect383.py first_player second_player board_size'

example for playing against the non-heuristic minimax agent:
'python connect383.py mini human 4x4'
